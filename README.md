# EECS-293-HW5: UXB
Implementation of the UXB system in Scala for a Software Craftsmanship project at CWRU in Fall 2016

###Description of "UXB" from project PDF:

The UXB (Universal eXtreme Bus) is a new (fictitious) standard to connect peripherals to computers. It was originally planned as a replacement for multiple existing standards, such as USB or HDMI. In the planning stage, a new feature was introduced: a single UXB device can have multiple ports so that the same device can be connected to multiple computers. For example, a printer can be plugged into multiple nearby computers, all of which would be able to print. In addition, a Webcam can be connected to several computers, enabling multiple users to access the same video feed. Furthermore, multiple ports introduce redundancy and consequently better fault tolerance. For example, if a peripheral is connected twice to a computer, then the device can continue to operate even if a cable or an UXB hub fails. Although multiple device ports seemed a great idea, they caused no end of aggravation to the UXB programmer (you!).
